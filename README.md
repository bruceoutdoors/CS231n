CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition - Assignment Solutions
===============

The course website: http://cs231n.stanford.edu/

Here are my solutions for this above course (Winter 2016), for the benefit of people who struggle greatly to solve them (like myself). I myself (and some of my coursemates) did not enrolled in Stanford to take this course; I just have generous access to the course notes, lecture videos and assignment code, which is made public for everyone. Therefore I do not guarantee that my solutions are correct, so if you spot any errors do let me know.

As of this writing I have yet completed the course material; completed assignments are marked [***done!***], otherwise they are as originally downloaded from the course site.

Assignment list:

 * Assignment #1
 	* Q1: k-Nearest Neighbor classifier (20 points) [***done!***]
 	* Q2: Training a Support Vector Machine (25 points) [***done!***]
 	* Q3: Implement a Softmax classifier (20 points) [***done!***]
 	* Q4: Two-Layer Neural Network (25 points) [***done!***]
 	* Q5: Higher Level Representations: Image Features (10 points) [***done!***]
 * Assignment #2
 	* Q1: Fully-connected Neural Network (30 points) [***done!***]
 	* Q2: Batch Normalization (30 points)
 	* Q3: Dropout (10 points)
 	* Q4: ConvNet on CIFAR-10 (30 points)
 * Assignment #3
 	* Q1: Image Captioning with Vanilla RNNs (40 points)
 	* Q2: Image Captioning with LSTMs (35 points)
 	* Q3: Image Gradients: Saliency maps and Fooling Images (10 points)
 	* Q4: Image Generation: Classes, Inversion, DeepDream (15 points)

Oh, and you should check out [MyHumbleSelf's Assignment Solutions](https://github.com/MyHumbleSelf/cs231n). This guy is a Stanford student, so his answers would likely be what you will get if you enrolled yourself. His is from the previous intake; if you looking for Winter 2016 intake, check out [ctheory's assignment solutions](https://github.com/cthorey/CS231).
